# Web Development Project 6 - LocalDrafts

## Check it out here! -> [Local Drafts](https://lumberger22.github.io/LocalDrafts/)

Submitted by: **Lucas Umberger**

**Local Drafts is an innovative web application designed for beer enthusiasts and casual drinkers alike, offering a dynamic and user-friendly platform to discover breweries in their immediate vicinity. By harnessing the power of location-based technology, Local Drafts displays a detailed map pinpointing nearby breweries, ranging from well-known establishments to hidden gems off the beaten path. The user can filter their results by name search or by brewery type.**

 - Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
 - Framework: React
 - APIs used:

     - Google Maps JS API --> [Documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript)

Time spent: **24** hours spent in total

## User Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The list displays a list of data fetched using an API call**
- [x] **Data uses the useEffect React hook and async/await syntax**
- [x] **The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data such as nearest brewery, breweries shown, and a map pinpointing breweries shown based on latitude and   longitude**
- [x] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
- [x] **Multiple different filters (2+) allow the user to filter items in the database by specified categories**
- [x] **The app includes at least one unique data visualization developed using the fetched data that tell an interesting story**
- [x] **Clicking on an item in the list view displays more details about it**
- [x] **Clicking on an item has a direct, unique link to that item's detail view page**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously
- [x] Filters use different input types such as a text input, a selection, or a slider

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] All filtered breweries are displayed on a map and can be interacted with
* [x] Brewery Detail Cards are linked to brewery website if provided in API call
* [x] Header sidebar provides navigational links to parts of the page

## Challenges

  - One of the biggest challenges I had was getting the map to display on the screen with the markers. I originally was using a deprecated react-google-maps API because I did not know about the Google Maps Platform that has a JS Maps API. I then switched to it and was able to render the map successfully. I then had to figure out how to get the Markers on the screen and map through them. I was able to pass props to the map so that when it is updated in App.jsx, the map rerenders and markers update.
  - Another challenge I had was with getting the filters to work on the list and filteredResults arrays. To get to the solution I decided on, the stucture went through several revisions that involved changing methods and adding different variables. I orignially was using the filtered results starting at zero and when a filter was changed I would put the filtered results into the array. This however caused errors with trying to load the filtered results when no results were found. I ended up starting with filteredResults being the full json, and trimming it down if a filter was changed.
  - Working on the second part of the project, where I implemented the detail cards that are linked to the dashboard listing, I had trouble getting the results to save for the user. By this I mean that when the user applied a filter to the inital brewery list, went to the detail page, and went back to the dashboard, the filters were reset. I wanted to keep the filters on for usability. I initally was going to pass a state prop in between links but could not effectively pass the selected types list and search input string. I ended up using the sessionStorage to hold the filters and updated them each time the page was reset.
